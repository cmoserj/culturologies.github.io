My name is Cody Moser. I am a PhD candidate and Fletcher Jones Fellow in the [Department of Cognitive and Information Sciences](https://cogsci.ucmerced.edu/) at UC Merced. In 2025, I will be an incoming Assistant Professor at the [School of Collective Intelligence](https://sci.um6p.ma/) at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University.

I work on questions examining the relationship between structure and adaptation in social, biological, economic, and neural systems from a complex systems perspective. To do this, I utilize methods from network theory, agent-based modeling, and large-scale corpus analysis.

Please reach out to me either via [email](mailto:cmoser2@ucmerced.edu) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LTF_01) if you would like to chat.

In the meantime, here's a collaboration network I made of my department. We have 51 nodes, an average clustering coefficient of .17, and a path length of 3.39. In my work on innovation and collective problem-solving, I have yet to find an organization of this size that is as innovative as ours.

<em>The strong message for successful ongoing adaptive evolution is ‘Keep a masterpiece and, at the same time, continue to explore adaptive space with mutational variants.’</em> - [Toquenaga & Wade, 1996](https://culturologies.co/files/toquenaga1996.pdf)
